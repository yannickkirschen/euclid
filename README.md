# Euclid

This will calculate the greatest common divisor by applying both the euclidean
algorithm and the extended euclidean algorithm.

Shootout to [@mrtz4thm](https://github.com/mrtz4thm) who gave me the inspiration
for this project!

The code has been taken from Wikipedia:

- [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)
- [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm)

## Usage

```shell
make
build/euclid <a> <b>
```
